# Long Term Localization
Pole-like Objects Mapping and Long-Term Robot Localization is an algorithm that makes robot or UAV locate itself in Dynamic Urban Scenarios robustly and accurately by correcting the real time Lidar odometry.

# 2 Build

## 2.1 Install dependencies
Please take a look the [README](https://github.com/HITSZ-NRSL/long-term-localization/blob/master/src/common/README.md) in `long-term-localization/src/common` folder.
And the size of the model file is too big, the training process can refer to the range-net++ in "long-term-localization/src/other_pkgs/lidar-bonnetal/" folder.

## 2.2 build lio_sam
```
cd ~
mkdir -p lio_sam_ws/src
cd lio_sam_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/nixwang/lio_sam.git
cd ../
catkin_make
```

## 2.3 Build
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/HITSZ-NRSL/long-term-localization.git
cd long-term-localization/src
git clone https://github.com/lisilin013/third_parities.git

cd ..
# When you build this ws for the first time, it may take a long time, be patient please.
catkin build
```


# 3 Run

## 3.1 Semantic Processing
```bash
# terminal 1
cd ~/lio_sam_ws
roslaunch lio_sam run.launch 

# terminal 2
cd long-term-localization
./sh/record.sh

# terminal 3
rosbag play 2020-10-12-demo.bag --clock 
```
When the bag run over, shut down the terminal 2 and 3; 

Then run below code to extract the semantic.

pytorch version necessary:

pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cudatoolkit=10.1

The trained CNN model can be download here.
```

```
or in google drive
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d7nw5IuQdAzLGRM5W_cP4LZbxnh2_3lw/view?usp=sharing
```

and unzip the model file in "long-term-localization/src/other_pkgs/lidar-bonnetal", then run below sh file.

```bash
cd long-term-localization
./sh/offline_process.sh
```


## 3.2 Mapping
Modify the following code in config file `src/long_term_relocalization/config/long_term_relocalization_params.yaml`
change to `localizaion` mode.
```
relocalization:
  mode: localization
```

```
# play bag
cd ~/offline_process/sequences/00
rosbag play semantic.bag --clock

# launch mapping nodes.
roslaunch long_term_relocalization mapping.launch

# when you want to save pole cluster map, open another terminal and run the following cmd.
rosrun long_term_relocalization save_cluster_map 
```
The cluster_map will be saved in "\tmp\clusters_map.bin"


## 3.3 Localization


 - Notes: The bag to be matched (2020-11-05-demo.bag) need to run the process in **3.1 Semantic Processing** to extract the semantic cluster, and then used for matching and relocalization. 

### 3.3.1 Semantic Processing

```bash
# terminal 1
roslaunch lio_sam run.launch 

# terminal 2
./sh/record.sh

# terminal 3
rosbag play 2020-11-05-demo.bag --clock 
```
When the bag run over, shut down the terminal 2 and 3; 

Then run below code to extract the semantic.

```bash
./sh/offline_process.sh
```

### 3.3.2 Localization

Modify the following code in config file `src/long_term_relocalization/config/long_term_relocalization_params.yaml`
change to `relocalization` mode.
```
relocalization:
  mode: relocalization
```

```
# launch relocalization nodes.
roslaunch long_term_relocalization relocalization.launch
```

Then play the processed bag (by 2020-11-05-demo.bag) to match with "clusters_map.bin".

```
cd ~/offline_process/sequences/00
rosbag play semantic.bag --clock   
```
