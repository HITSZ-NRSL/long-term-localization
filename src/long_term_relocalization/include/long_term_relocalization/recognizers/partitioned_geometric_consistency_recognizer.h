/// \brief Recognizes a model in a scene using a graph-based approach. First a consistency graph
/// is constructed, where the nodes represent the matches and edges connect matches that are
/// pairwise consistent. Recognition finds a maximum clique matches that are pairwise consistent.
/// The partitioned approach assumes that the model is relatively small compared to the scene. This
/// allows to partition the space in a voxel grid with resolution equal to the size of the model
/// and efficiently discard all pairwise matches that are two or more voxels apart, i.e. too
/// distant to be consistent given the model size.
/// \remark The current implementation assumes that the model and the scene are almost planar,
/// and partitioning is necessary only on the X and Y axis. Extension to 3D is possible by using
/// 3D partitioning.
